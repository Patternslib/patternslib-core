# Patterns

Patterns is a toolkit that enables designers to build rich
interactive prototypes without the need for writing any JavaScript. All events
are triggered by classes and other attributes in the HTML, without abusing the
HTML as a programming language. Accessibility, SEO and well structured HTML are
core values of Patterns.

This is the core library of patternslib.
